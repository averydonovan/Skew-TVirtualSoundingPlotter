# Skew-T Virtual Sounding Plotter

## About

A program to generate Skew-T meteorological data plots from GRIB files output by 
meteorological forecasting models, also known as a virtual sounding.
It is intended for use as an easy-to-use educational tool by students or
researchers.

The program uses the
[UCAR/Unidata NetCDF-Java](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/)
library for GRIB file reading.
Currently it is able to read GRIB1 and GRIB2 files published on the
[NOAA NOMADS](http://nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov/data.php?name=access) site.

## Features

* Read GRIB1 and GRIB2 files output by the NOAA RAP, NAM, and GFS forecasting
  models
* Generate high-quality Skew-T/Log-P plots from temperature and dew point data
  at various isobaric levels
* Convert relative humidity to dew point as needed
* Calculate values such as lifting condensation level (LCL), K-index,
  Total Totals, and SWEAT depending on data available
* Output high-resolution (approximately 328 DPI) plot to a PNG file

## Requirements

### Running

#### Version 0.3.0 and later
* For Windows: double-click on "SkewTVSP.cmd" inside installation folder 

#### Versions prior to 0.3.0
* Must have Java 8 SE runtime installed
* Double-click downloaded JAR file

### Building

* Java 11 Development Kit
* OpenJFX 11
* Apache Maven 3

Maven should pull in all required dependencies automatically.
Simply run `mvn clean compile package` to build and `mvn exec:java` to run.
