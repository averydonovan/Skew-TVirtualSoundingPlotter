# Skew-T Virtual Sounding Plotter

## About

A program to generate Skew-T meteorological data plots from GRIB files output by 
meteorological forecasting models, also known as a virtual sounding.
It is intended for use as an easy-to-use educational tool by students or
researchers.

The program uses the
[UCAR/Unidata NetCDF-Java](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf-java/)
library for GRIB file reading.

Currently it is able to read GRIB1 and GRIB2 files for certain models published on the
[NOAA NOMADS](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/) site.

Licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.

## Features

* Read GRIB1 and GRIB2 files output by the NOAA RAP, NAM, and GFS forecasting
  models
* Generate high-quality Skew-T/Log-P plots from temperature and dew point data
  at various isobaric levels
* Convert relative humidity to dew point as needed
* Calculate values such as lifting condensation level (LCL), K-index,
  Total Totals, and SWEAT depending on data available
* Output high-resolution (approximately 328 DPI) plot to a PNG file

### Supported model output files

* GFS (filenames containing `.pgrb2.`)
* RAP (filenames containing `.awp130pgrbf`)
* HRRR (filenames containing `.wrfprsf`)
* NAM (filenames containing `.awphys`)

## Requirements

### Important

It is recommended to use the latest 0.3.0 alpha version.
Despite the "alpha" label, these versions now bundle the necessary Java runtime and they
contain bug fixes for reading some model output files, as well as other fixes and enhancements.

Development is mainly targeting Windows for now.
Support for Linux is only being tested on Debian 12 on Windows Subsystem for Linux.
Building may work on other Unix-like systems (e.g. macOS or FreeBSD) but isn't being tested.

### Running

#### Windows

* Windows 10 (64-bit) or later

Double-click on "SkewTVSP.exe" inside installation folder.

#### Linux

* Recent Linux x86_64 distribution

Run `bin/SkewTVSP` inside installation folder. 

### Building

#### Windows

* Windows 10 or later
* [OpenJDK 21](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/)
* [Apache Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (if creating archive for distribution)
* [WiX v3](https://wixtoolset.org/docs/wix3/) (if creating Windows installer)

Maven should pull in all required dependencies automatically.
Simply run `mvn clean compile package` to build and `mvn javafx:run` to run.

To create a distribution, run `.\create-dist.cmd`, `.\create-dist.cmd archive`,
or `.\create-dist.cmd installer`
to create a folder, archive file, or installer, respectively.

#### Linux

* [OpenJDK 17 or later](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
* [Apache Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/)
* xmllint (can be found in libxml2-utils package in Debian-based distributions)

Maven should pull in all required dependencies automatically.
Simply run `mvn clean compile package` to build and `mvn javafx:run` to run.

To create a distribution, run `./create-dist.sh` or `./create-dist.sh archive`
to create a folder or archive, respectively.

## Citing/Acknowledging

Citing or acknowledging Skew-T Virtual Sounding Plotter in works that use plots
generated by it is *not* required; however, it is much appreciated.
